            What do you mean by REST API?

            >Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style
            that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web
            services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple
            and flexible way without having any processing.REST technology is
            generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol
            (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, simple and
            flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. Its used to
            fetch or give some information from a web service. All communication
            done via REST API uses only HTTP request.A request is sent from
            client to server in the form of a web URL as HTTP GET or POST or PUT
            or DELETE request. After that, a response comes back from the server
            in the form of a resource which can be anything like HTML, XML,
            Image, or JSON. But now JSON is the most popular format being used
            in Web Services. In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly
            used in a REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and
            DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or
            CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are
            less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD.
